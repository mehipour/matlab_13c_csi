# matlab_13c_csi
Process Hyperpolarized carbon-13 and xenon-129 spectroscopic magnetic resonance images using CSI and EPSI pulse sequences in Matlab.

A comprehensive library to process and visualize MRI images obtained from Varian and Bruker scanners. 
* Visualize dicom images and retrieve their metadata.
* Calculate signal to noise ratio.
* Denoise MRI images and spectra using wavelets.
* Process hyperpoarlized 13C and 129Xe MRI spectra and visualize them. 
* Estimate kinetic rate constants from dynamic MRI studies.
